# Peer Review - Medical Insurance Costs - Craig Wilcox

https://github.com/s256657/ml_regression_craigwilcox/blob/main/regression_craigwilcox.ipynb 

Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
- Craig's notebook was structured well and easy to follow. His notebook has all the sections needed to complete this project and are numbered correctly. 

Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
- Based off the objective of his project, his chosen features of age, bmi, and smoker make sense. He chose to use his features based off his charts that were displayed in Section 2. 

Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
- Craig's models performed well and used three different tests and compare the results well. He explained his findings well and it made sense to his objective, while also giving some insight about what could have been better. 

Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
- I think his insights and reflections on each section are explained well and effectively demonstrated his thought process and purpose. I really like his quote from a previous mentor of his that said "I can make data say anything I want but it is better to have the data speak what is true."
